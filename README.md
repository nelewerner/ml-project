# Inner Speech Recognition - A CNN Analysis

Based on BCIs, this project aims to interpret EEG data for directional thought tasks using neural networks in Python.  
The data was collected in Argentina. 10 subjects were shown an arrow on the screen and had to speak aloud the word,  
think of the word, or imagine a dot shown on the screen moving in the indicated direction. Preprocessed EEG data is  
available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truthisneverlinear/inner-speech-recognition)
